![image-20200520223746802](images/image-20200520223746802.png)

##### Hostname or IP address

> **Be aware that when using Bazarr in docker, you cannot reach another container on the same Docker host using the loopback address (ex.: 127.0.0.1 or localhost). Loopback address refer to the Bazarr Docker container, not the Docker host.**

##### Port Number

Enter the TCP port of your Sonarr instance. Default is 8989.

##### URL Base

Mainly used by those who expose Sonarr behind a reverse proxy (ex.: /sonarr). Don't forget the leading slash. In fact, it should look exactly the same as in Sonarr settings. Mainly used when you use a reverse proxy.

> **If you don't use a reverse proxy or don't know what it is leave this empty !!!**

##### SSL enabled

Enable this if your Sonarr instance is exposed trough SSL.

> **Not needed if you reach it with a local IP address.**

##### API key

Enter your Sonarr API key here.

> Click the `Test` button after filling in all the fields. Make sure the test is successful before you proceed.

#### Options

![image-20200723142916426](images/image-20200723142916426.png)

##### Minimum Score

Select the minimal score (in percentage) required for a subtitles file to be downloaded. *Are your subs often out of sync? Raise the score!*

##### Download Only Monitored

Automatic download of Subtitles will only happen for monitored shows/episodes in Sonarr.

##### Exluded Tags

Episodes from series with those tags (case sensitive) in Sonarr will be excluded from automatic download of Subtitles.
In Sonarr you add a custom made tag to a show, in this case the shows with these tags will be ignored by Bazarr. examples: `dutch`, `anime`

##### Excluded Series Types

Episodes from series with those types in Sonarr will be excluded from automatic download of Subtitles.
Options: Standard, Anime, Daily

#### Path Mappings

![image-20200723144000147](images/image-20200723144000147.png)

**You should only use this section if Sonarr and Bazarr use a different path to access the same episode file (.mkv).**
**(for example if you run Sonarr on a different device then Bazarr or have a Synology and mix packages with Docker.)**

> ![animated-exclamation-mark-image-0006](images/animated-exclamation-mark-image-0006.gif)
>
> **IF YOU GOT THE SAME VALUES ON BOTH SIDES THEN YOU DON'T NEED IT !!!**
> **IT SHOULD ALSO BE REMOVED OR ELSE YOU WILL GET A ERROR.**
>
> ![animated-exclamation-mark-image-0006](images/animated-exclamation-mark-image-0006.gif)

Click on `Add` and you will get a popup window
![image-20200724211005207](images/image-20200724211005207.png)

Ex.:

* Browse or type the path for Sonarr: `/media/tv_shows/seriesX/`
* Browse or type the path for Bazarr: `\\nas\tv\seriesX\

The common part of both path can be discarded and you should use those values:

* Path for Sonarr: `/media/tv_shows/`
* Path for Bazarr: `\\nas\tv\`

>  *If everything runs on Docker you normally don't need to use this. Except if you have messed up path mappings and then it would be smarter to fix those first to have consistency and well planned paths.*
